2. Make a git repository and commit your solution to Assignment 1 to it.

3. Push the repository to the AUC gitlab server.

4. Ensure that all members of the gitlab group advprog-spring18 can access your repository.

      a. Go to the project page for your Assignment 1 on the gitlab server.

      b. On the left bar, click on Members.

      c. Click on Share with group.

      d. Type advprog-spring18 as the group to share

      e. Set the Max access level to Developer

      f. Click Share

5. Check with a fellow student that your repository can be accessed.


## Reviewing


These steps should be carried out during the peer review phase, not earlier.

1. Review your fellow student's code. Note that:

    - You have to review only one student's code.

    - You can see who's code you are reviewing; it is no longer anonymous.

2. Provide feedback to the fellow student in two ways.

    a. On the gitlab server, you should make at least one issue containing a suggestion to improve the code.

    b. Using git,

     - Fork the repository

     - Clone your fork of the repository to your VM

     - Make a new branch

     - Make an improvement to the code

     - Commit it to the branch

     - Push the new branch to gitlab

     - Make a merge request on the gitlab server
