# Advanced Programming

This is Marik's GitHub for Advanced Programming at AUC in the Spring 2018 semester. I upload stuff here that I might use. Feel free to take a look for inspiration, but be aware that everything posted here is my original work, and I can not be held accountable if you plagiarize my work.

Used is the [Advanced Programming](http://advprog.auc-computing.nl/) website by Breanndán Ó Nualláin.
