# Student groups

Design a Python program to help a teacher randomly divide a class into groups for a number of assignments.

The teacher has information about all of the students in the class in students.csv, which is a file in csv format and would like the output to be also written to a csv file, something like assignment-teams.csv.

The teacher would also like, in so far as is possible,

* for each student to be in a group with different students for each assignment;

* that the groups are all of the same size (plus or minus one);


The Python program should take four arguments:

1. the number of assignments

2. the number of students per group

3. the name of the input csv file

4. the name of the output csv file
